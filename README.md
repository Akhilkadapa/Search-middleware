# Search-middleware
personal project to master search middleware tasks 

This project is a scalable search middleware built using Node.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript, with third-party search integration using Algolia. The middleware aims to enhance search functionality for web applications by leveraging real-time data synchronization, metadata-driven searches, and event-driven architecture using Kafka.

The primary objective of this project is to improve the search experience by providing fast, relevant, and user-friendly search results. The search system is designed to evolve into a more intelligent platform, eventually incorporating Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to offer personalized recommendations and search intent predictions.
